This is a Spreadsheet application initially created for WSU CPT_S 321 course taught by Venera Arnaoudova. This has been decently modified since the end of that course so if you want to take concepts from it, good luck.  


You can access custom cell functions by typing =(CellName). For example, if you wanted to add the values of Cells A1 and B2, you could type =A1+B2. 

This application has had the following additions made to it: 
- Slight multithreading
- Keyboard shortcuts added to the UI
